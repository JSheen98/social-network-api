# Social Network API

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

The goal for this project was first, for me to gain a better understanding of the non-relational NoSQL database. Next, was to create a flexible database API that could be easily queried and updated for a social network backend. Lastly, I wanted to add several connections to showcase that even though this uses non-relational functionality, you can still reference other documents and models.
